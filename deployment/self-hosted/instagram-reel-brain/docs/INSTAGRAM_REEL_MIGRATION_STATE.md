# Instagram Reel Migration State

Status: Phase 4 shadow live intake observation passed independent review.
Bounded Phase 5 preparation is implemented and deployed. The first live
controlled-compute pilot is waiting for one brand-new Reel share to be
explicitly identified and fenced.

Cloudflare remains the only production authority. The local scaffold does not
receive Meta callbacks, claim jobs, call Codex, send Instagram output, publish
Pages/KV/R2 data, or process backlog except for a future exactly fenced
one-job Phase 5 pilot after explicit approval.

Phase 3 is recorded in `PHASE_3_GATE_REPORT_2026-08-21.md`. Phase 4 start is
recorded in `PHASE_4_START_REPORT_2026-08-21.md`; the current timestamp
correction and historical validation blocker are recorded in
`PHASE_4_TIMESTAMP_CORRECTION_REPORT_2026-08-21.md`; the completed corrected
historical replay validation is recorded in
`PHASE_4_HISTORICAL_REPLAY_VALIDATION_REPORT_2026-08-21.md`. Phase 5
preparation is recorded in `PHASE_5_PREP_REPORT_2026-08-22.md`.

## Enabled

- Six container-internal health endpoints.
- Isolated Docker networks `cartdotcom-reel-runtime` and
  `cartdotcom-reel-egress`.
- Empty local storage roots prepared for later phases.
- Example backup and secret contracts.
- Non-authoritative Phase 3 PostgreSQL JSONB audit schema
  `reel_phase3_shadow_20260821_040408`.
- Non-authoritative Phase 3 typed operational shadow schema
  `reel_phase3_operational_20260821_040408`.
- ACL-restricted workstation and server Phase 3 D1 snapshots under ignored
  run paths.
- Server-side R2 shadow copy of all 5,673 bucket objects under
  `/srv/cartdotcom/reel-brain-runs/phase3-shadow/2026-08-21_04-04-08`.
- Local library manifests generated from copied data only.
- Dedicated Phase 4 mirror credential `PHASE4_MIRROR_TOKEN`, stored as a
  Cloudflare Worker secret and on the Ubuntu server at
  `/srv/cartdotcom/reel-brain-secrets/phase4-mirror-token` with mode `0600`.
- Read-only authenticated Phase 4 Worker endpoints on corrected Worker version
  `b7d06948-4cd5-4d59-a88d-56049b0ce53d`:
  `/api/phase4/mirror/delta` and `/api/phase4/mirror/object`.
- Non-authoritative Phase 4 shadow schema
  `reel_phase4_shadow_20260821_014246`.
- Phase 4 start watermark `2026-08-21T01:42:46Z`; latest corrected formal
  observation start `2026-08-21T03:01:28Z` after the timestamp-normalised
  endpoint mirrored nonempty live rows successfully.
- Server-side Phase 4 mirror run directory
  `/srv/cartdotcom/reel-brain-runs/phase4-shadow/2026-08-21_01-42-46`.
- Non-authoritative Phase 4 historical replay validation schema
  `reel_phase4_replay_20260821_031920`, run directory
  `/srv/cartdotcom/reel-brain-runs/phase4-replay/2026-08-21_03-19-20`, and
  object root with 1,075 verified copied objects for the approved slice
  `2026-08-19T04:19:57Z <= created_at < 2026-08-21T01:42:46Z`.
- Cron-supervised Phase 4 mirror watchdog and health sampler for the
  observation gate. The old raw `nohup` PIDs are stopped and preserved only as
  evidence. The mirror watchdog now verifies process command identity before
  trusting `mirror-supervised.pid`; corrected mirror PID `3168918` is running
  after a stale/reused-PID replacement test.
- Empty production D1 Phase 5 fence table `phase5_local_pilot_fences`, created
  by migration `0021_phase5_local_pilot_fence.sql`.
- Admin-only Cloudflare Phase 5 fence/rollback endpoints on Worker version
  `4e80693d-cb8f-4728-9528-1f2e6d700d32`.
- Non-authoritative local Phase 5 lease/event tables from
  `0005_phase5_controlled_pilot.sql`, with one-active-lease enforcement through
  `phase5_pilot_leases_one_active_idx`.
- Synthetic-only local Phase 5 harness for media, transcription, Codex schema,
  token accounting, reaction audit, publication artifact, private playback, and
  R2-mirror receipt checks.

## Disabled

- Intake.
- Dispatch.
- Worker execution.
- Codex.
- Outbound delivery.
- Mutations.
- Backlog.
- Publisher.
- Archiver.
- Auth rotation.
- Local processing authority.
- Local job claims.
- Local Codex execution.
- Local publisher.
- Instagram outbound actions.
- Historical backlog enumeration, replay, selection, or processing.
- Production D1/R2/KV mutation.
- Phase 5 authority cutover.
- Temporary historical replay credential `PHASE4_REPLAY_TOKEN`; the corrected
  replay credential was created only for validation, then revoked and removed
  from the Ubuntu server after validation completed.
- Unrestricted Phase 5 local claims; only one future exact admin-fenced job may
  be processed locally.
- Live Phase 5 pilot execution until a brand-new Reel share is explicitly
  identified.
- Phase 6 or general production authority cutover.

## Limits

- Total Reel project memory ceiling: 1.75 GiB.
- Total Reel project CPU ceiling: 1.85 cores.
- Worker concurrency: 1.
- PID limit: 128 per service.
- No host ports.
- No shared `cartdotcom-edge` or `cartdotcom-data` membership in Phase 1.

## Current gate

Phase 4 passed independent review with corrected observation from
`2026-08-21T03:01:28Z` through after `2026-08-21T15:01:28Z`: 144 mirror polls,
0 failures, 409 live row versions, 279 current object receipts, 0 divergences,
0 mirror errors, 12 nonempty polls, and 144 health samples with no
Cloudflare/backlog or Docker health failure. The historical replay remains
exactly 50 jobs, 200 events, 722 artifacts, 258 resources, 1,075 object
receipts, 0 divergences, and 0 errors.

Phase 5 preparation is complete through the readiness gate. The system is
waiting for one brand-new Reel share to be explicitly identified. After that,
an admin must fence the exact durable `job_id` and `source_message_id` before
local compute is allowed. No carousel, retrieval case, second pilot, Phase 6
work, or authority cutover is approved before the first fenced Reel completes
and receives independent review.
