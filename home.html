                    <p class="blogbodytext">Most of the core features have been added to the game. The player runs around in 8 directions with their sprite only changing from left to right. They can shoot where the mouse is pointing. They have 100 health and take 10 per hit. The enemies also have 100 but take 50 per bullet. These numbers are obviously subject to change. The main floor has been set and will most likely stay at 2560x1440 with a camera view of 1920x1080. The camera follows the player unless it is about to display any area outside of this floor, in which case it will stop. The enemies spawn on platforms around the floor in random locations. Small stats such as the player movement, enemy movement, volecity, damage, health, etc. are not set in stone and are very likely to change.</p>
                    <br> <p class="blogbodytext">Here is a video demonstration of the features.</p>

                    <p class="blogbodytext">The game will be a top-down survival shooter similar to Vampire Survivors. The player will survive by shooting hordes of enemies. The player will be able to walk in 8 directions; up, down, left, right and the diagonals along each, however, they will be able to shoot in every direction. The enemies will move freely and walk constantly towards the player. The number of enemies and their strength will scale with each level. After each kill, the enemies will drop experience, after collecting a certain amount of experience the player will be able to select an upgrade to have within the round, these will include things such as move speed, shoot speed, damage, health, healing rate etc. Every few levels they will be able to select a permanent upgrade, e.g. the first permanent upgrade is available after 10 regular upgrades, the next one is available after 12, the next after 14. There will be 3 enemy types, regular, with a regular amount of health e.g. 100, small, who move faster but have less health e.g. double move speed with 50 health, and large enemies who move slower but have more health e.g. double health, half move speed. Each enemy type will drop different amounts of xp. XP and the health of the enemies will remain the same throughout each round, the challenge does not come from an increase in enemy stats but an increase in their numbers.</p>
                    <br> <p class="blogbodytext">Here is a similar game to vampire survivors with all of the aforementioned features highlighted.</p>

                    <p class="blogbodytext">Asteroids, originally, had the sole challenge of dodging and breaking meteors flying towards or around the player, while allowing them to move freely within a 2-dimensional space. To add challenge, the player will not face other ships, varying in manoeuvrability, shot type and awareness. The player no longer has a completely clear space to work with and must pay attention to obstacles such as small ships and planets. The player will receive an upgrade over the old game in the form of new types of guns that change how to player shoots and personal upgrades, such as the speed at which they move, their health and informative displays, such as another opponent’s trajectory and a mini map to give them an idea of where other ships and obstacle are. The game has no definitive win state, however, upon dying, the player is shown a summary of their game, such as how long they were alive, how many other ships of each difficulty they shot down and what upgrades they acquired, allowing the player to set the standard for what a good game looks like.</p>

                    <p class="blogbodytext">My process was heavy based around the GDevelop’s built in tools, which, I feel, limited my control over many aspects of the game. It also pulled my attention away from those more crucial details to focus on the rest of the game as, in my mind, those features had been looked after. It was only during my personal playtest that I realised how slow and awkward the movement felt. Watching a small alien take several seconds to reach maximum speed felt wrong, especially in a game that is trying to emphasise movement and speed. </p>
                    <br> <p class="blogbodytext">Something I am very thankful for, however, is GDevelop’s built in sprite and animation editor. Had I not convinced myself that I shouldn’t put too much effort into a rough version of a game, I would have utilized these to their full potential to completely animate anything that needed animation: character, upgrades, background. With creating static sprites alone, the tool was very helpful, providing some tools that I had not seen in a pixel art software anywhere else.</p>
                    <br> <p class="blogbodytext"> I didn’t implement any kind of audio into this game, partially because I was developing it without headphones in and partially because sound design for a rough draft did not seem completely necessary. Looking back, the game would only really have had 3 sounds, 4 if I was creative and assigned a sound to the player landing, but that can be an addition for after public playtesting.</p>

                    <p class="blogbodytext">The draft of the platformer game is complete. You are an alien who falls down a cave and you need to make your way back up to your ship by collecting upgrades and making tough jumps. The character has very simple animations and unrefined movement stats. The upgrades are basic and unrefined, providing an arbitrary amount of each stat. The background is fixed and is a repeating rock pattern. The platforms are more repeating rock patterns, light on the outside, darker on the inside and black further in. The game lacks any kind of menus or settings, points system, timer or option to restart without relaunching. The controls consist of 3 keys: A, D and W, for left, right and jump respectively. The gameplay loop is simple and may have been effective if the user didn’t have to relaunch to try and beat their previous time, which would be completely based on their intuition as there is no timer. The coyote time is very lenient and almost acts as a double jump.</p>
                    <br> <p class="blogbodytext">I would have liked to spend more time developing my own version of many of the features, such as the player movement, timer, upgrade and coyote time in order to have complete control over how the function. I did however learn about hiding and showing elements and modifying objects behaviour stats through events.</p>

                    <p class="blogbodytext">The platformer takes place in a single room. The aim is to reach a goal within, or climb out of, this single room. The player must collect upgrades for their character as they climb higher. The challenge comes in the form of precise jumps, most of which only become possible once the player has collected a certain amount of each upgrade. The player is punished for not executing their jumps well enough by causing them to fall to the bottom of the room and start the climb up again. The replayability appears in the form of the player’s desire to become faster at climbing out of the room. Games that follow a similar gameplay style include Jump King or Pogostuck. These games do not have upgrades and therefore rely solely on player skill to create boundaries in progress like the game in this pitch. The game can follow any theme or style, which will probably be decided during or after the production of the game. Styles from other games include climbing out of caves, climbing up towers or traversing fantasy worlds.</p>

This translates into my aim when playing or making games, which is that the player can create a second version of themselves and play uniquely from anyone else. Another interest of mine is prioritising user experience over all else. As the games in GDevelop are simple, my aim for this semester is to improve my ability to create a great user experience regardless of my engine. I have experience with JavaScript and C# and find logic very easy to figure out, that is why, moving forward, my aim is not solely to improve my programming or engine utilisation skills, but instead to focus primarily on how I apply my previously acquired skills and knowledge to make the best game that I can.</p>
