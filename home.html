                    <p class="blogbodytext">Most of the core features have been added to the game. The player runs around in 8 directions with their sprite only changing from left to right. They can shoot where the mouse is pointing. They have 100 health and take 10 per hit. The enemies also have 100 but take 50 per bullet. These numbers are obviously subject to change. The main floor has been set and will most likely stay at 2560x1440 with a camera view of 1920x1080. The camera follows the player unless it is about to display any area outside of this floor, in which case it will stop. The enemies spawn on platforms around the floor in random locations. Small stats such as the player movement, enemy movement, volecity, damage, health, etc. are not set in stone and are very likely to change.</p>
                    <br> <p class="blogbodytext">Here is a video demonstration of the features.</p>

                    <p class="blogbodytext">The game will be a top-down survival shooter similar to Vampire Survivors. The player will survive by shooting hordes of enemies. The player will be able to walk in 8 directions; up, down, left, right and the diagonals along each, however, they will be able to shoot in every direction. The enemies will move freely and walk constantly towards the player. The number of enemies and their strength will scale with each level. After each kill, the enemies will drop experience, after collecting a certain amount of experience the player will be able to select an upgrade to have within the round, these will include things such as move speed, shoot speed, damage, health, healing rate etc. Every few levels they will be able to select a permanent upgrade, e.g. the first permanent upgrade is available after 10 regular upgrades, the next one is available after 12, the next after 14. There will be 3 enemy types, regular, with a regular amount of health e.g. 100, small, who move faster but have less health e.g. double move speed with 50 health, and large enemies who move slower but have more health e.g. double health, half move speed. Each enemy type will drop different amounts of xp. XP and the health of the enemies will remain the same throughout each round, the challenge does not come from an increase in enemy stats but an increase in their numbers.</p>
                    <br> <p class="blogbodytext">Here is a similar game to vampire survivors with all of the aforementioned features highlighted.</p>

                    <p class="blogbodytext">I have an interest in individuality and identity. This translates into my aim when playing or making games, which is that the player can create a second version of themselves and play uniquely from anyone else. Another interest of mine is prioritising user experience over all else. As the games in GDevelop are simple, my aim for this semester is to improve my ability to create a great user experience regardless of my engine. I have experience with JavaScript and C# and find logic very easy to figure out, that is why, moving forward, my aim is not solely to improve my programming or engine utilisation skills, but instead to focus primarily on how I apply my previously acquired skills and knowledge to make the best game that I can.</p>
